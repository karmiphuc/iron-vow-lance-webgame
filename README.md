# IRON VOW — Mercenary Command

A self-contained, original browser tactical mech game inspired by part-based strategy games such as Front Mission 3. No original game assets are used.

Open `dist/index.html` in a modern browser, or serve `dist/` through any static web server. No build step or dependencies are required. Fonts are optional external requests with local fallbacks.

## Play

Choose a contract, select one of three mechs, and click highlighted tiles to move. Choose Fire and click an enemy to attack its selected subsystem. Destroy the body to neutralize an enemy. Destroy its weapon arm to disable firing, legs to stop movement, or shield arm to reduce armor. Cover lowers hit chance except for missiles. Every action spends AP. Each pilot has a unique once-per-battle skill. End Turn advances the enemy lance.

Keyboard: 1–3 selects a unit; M moves; F fires; Q activates a skill; E ends the turn. Mouse/touch supports every action. Sound is opt-in.

Contract rewards fund four weapons, chassis upgrades, and repairs. Pilot experience increases damage. Career state saves to browser localStorage. Career screen supports backup export/import. Free field patches prevent an economy dead end.

## Verification

`node --check dist/game.js`

`node check.cjs` runs simulation checks with a minimal DOM/canvas stub: five screens, save validation, pathfinding, limb loss, skills, combat damage, bracing, enemy turns, victory and withdrawal, persistent rewards, and renderer smoke at mobile/tablet/desktop sizes. This is not browser visual QA.

## Scope

Three pilots, three chassis, four weapons, three repeatable contracts, and an ongoing mercenary progression loop. This is an original compact tactical game, not a reproduction of the full Front Mission 3 campaign, narrative, roster, or mechanics.
